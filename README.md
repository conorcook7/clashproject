# clashproject
Homework Project for Intro to Web Dev.

Author: Conor Cook

This was my very first Web Application that was ever made. 
For the scope of this project, I was limited to not use any frameworks and to use pure HTML, CSS, and PHP. 
Towards the end I added a splash of JavaScript and jQuery.

The main use of this application is to aid Clash of Clans players in caclulating their progress. 

You can enter the current level of all of your defensive structures then submit the form and the result will show how
much longer you will have till max level as well as the gold requirements.
